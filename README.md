Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension.

Problem Statement:
In this project, my goal was to build a predictive model to determine whether passengers will be transported to a distant planet. The task is a binary classification problem, where we aim to predict if a passenger will be "Transported" or "Not Transported."

Approach Overview:
I tackled the problem using a Random Forest classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method. The Random Forest algorithm combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, and it has the advantage of handling non-linear relationships in the data and providing insights into feature importance.

Data Preprocessing:
To prepare the data for the Random Forest model, I performed several preprocessing steps:
Encoded categorical variables: one-hot encoded the categorical features like "HomePlanet" and "Destination" to convert them into numerical format.
Handled missing values: I carefully examined the dataset and applied appropriate strategies to handle missing values in the "Age," "VIP," and other relevant columns.
Created new features: I extracted information from the "Cabin" column to generate new features such as "Deck," "Cabin Number," and "Side."

Model Training:
I split the given training dataset into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model. The Random Forest classifier was trained with 100 decision trees to avoid overfitting, and we set the random_state for reproducibility.

Evaluation Metric:
For model evaluation, I used accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.

Model Performance:
I trained Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 74.53% on the validation dataset, indicating its ability to generalize to unseen data. The model's performance was satisfactory, given the nature of the problem and the complexity of the dataset.

Final Predictions:
With confidence in trained model's performance, I made predictions on the provided test dataset. As the ground truth labels for the test data were not provided, I could not directly measure the accuracy on the test set. Instead, I made predictions based on the available features.

Improvements:
Although model performed reasonably well, there is always room for improvement. To enhance the model further, we could explore additional feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, or even try different algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the successful implementation of a Random Forest classifier to predict whether passengers will be transported to a distant planet. I hope my approach and methodology provide valuable insights into solving binary classification tasks in future projects.
